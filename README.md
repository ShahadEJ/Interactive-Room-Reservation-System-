# Interactive-Room-Reservation-System-
In our project, we aim on developing an application using the concept of object orianted programing working with Netbaens tool and 
designing a database using MySQL workbench for an interactive halls system thatâ€™s work on providing reservation service for the available halls in the system by filling the required information from the user to be updated for choosing the preferable date and time beside the nature of the reservation. The system owner will have the authority to perform many processes such as, adding, deleting, and updating the database. The user of the system will be asked to insert the required information
and after that will be upgraded to be able to make a reservation for a certain hall. The reservation can be for the entire hall or part of it.
